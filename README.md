# Business Sales Performance Dashboard

This project is a Power BI dashboard built to analyze, track, and evaluate overall business sales performance using structured data and interactive visualizations.

## Part 1: Project Overview
The dashboard focuses on transforming raw sales data into meaningful insights that can support business decisions. It presents a consolidated view of key metrics such as total sales, profit, quantity sold, returns, customers, and products. By combining multiple dimensions like time, region, product category, and customer segments, the dashboard enables a clear understanding of how the business is performing at both high and detailed levels.

The project is designed to answer practical business questions such as:
- Which products and categories are driving the most revenue and profit
- How sales performance varies across regions and time periods
- Which customers contribute the highest value
- Where returns are impacting profitability

## Part 2: Customer and Product Analysis

This section focuses on understanding customer behavior and product performance to identify key value drivers for the business. Customer-level analysis highlights top customers based on sales, profit, and order volume, helping identify high-value and repeat customers. It also provides insights into customer contribution, purchasing patterns, and their impact on overall revenue.

Product analysis evaluates performance across product categories and individual items. It helps identify best-selling and most profitable products, as well as low-performing items that may require pricing, promotion, or inventory adjustments. By analyzing sales, profit margins, and return rates at the product level, the dashboard supports informed decisions related to product strategy and portfolio optimization.

Together, customer and product analysis enables a deeper understanding of demand trends, customer preferences, and revenue concentration, supporting targeted marketing, improved product planning, and overall business growth.


Return analysis is included to evaluate operational efficiency and product issues. Customer-level insights help understand buying behavior and contribution to overall sales. The interactive filters allow users to drill down into specific segments and time ranges, making the analysis flexible and decision-oriented.
